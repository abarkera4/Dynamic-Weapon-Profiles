# Dynamic Weapon Profiles (DWP) - Version 2.2.0


## Profiles
==========================

- **Dynamic Weapon Profiles**: Dynamically change the stats of all weapons by selecting the desired profile from a dropdown menu.
- The '**None**' profile allows the use of default weapon stats while still gaining the benefits of dynamic stat changes and profile swapping. Extra Option checkboxes will dynamically apply to any profile.
- Better Weapon Balance is included by default as a profile. See below for details on stat changes.
- **Profiles are modular**, so you can create your own or download profiles from Nexus and plug them into **DWP**.
- For documentation on creating your own profile mods, an updated tutorial covering the new **live profile editor** is available in the [Modding Haven Discord](https://discord.gg/modding-haven-718224210270617702).

## Extra Options
==========================
